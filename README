This is the branch for the projectile physics

The Runge-Kutta routines solve

 d^2x/dt^2 = - k v dx/dt / m 

and

 d^2y/dt^2 = - k v dy/dt / m - g

In these equations the "up direction" is y and the motion is all
on the x-y plane.  When it is added to the rest of the code the
coordinates will need to be adjusted properly.
